            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              DriveDetect is an open-source computer vision research initiative.
              We are committed to ensuring transparency in how data is handled.
              This Privacy Policy outlines what information is collected, how it
              is used, and how users remain in control.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              DriveDetect does not collect, store, or transmit personal user data
              to external servers. Any image, video, or sensor input processed
              during live demonstrations remains local to the user's device.
              No biometric, identity, or behavioral data is retained.

            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              All AI inference and driver monitoring analysis occur locally
              within the user's runtime environment. The system is designed
              for research and experimentation purposes and does not perform
              remote cloud-based tracking.

              DriveDetect may contain links to third-party platforms such as GitHub.
              These platforms operate independently and have their own privacy
              policies. We encourage users to review those policies separately.

            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              While DriveDetect does not store personal data, we follow best
              practices in open-source development to maintain code integrity
              and transparency. Users are encouraged to run the software in
              secure environments and review source code before deployment.

            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              This Privacy Policy may be updated as the project evolves.
              Updates will reflect improvements in architecture, features,
              or integrations. Continued use of DriveDetect implies acceptance
              of the most recent version of this policy.
